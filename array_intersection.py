Prompt
Can you write a function that takes two arrays as inputs and returns to us their intersection? We can call the method intersection. 

Let's return the intersection of the two inputs in the form of an array. 
As a reminder, the definition of an intersection of two sets A and B is the set containing all elements of A 
that also belong to B (or equivalently, all elements of B that also belong to A).

nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]
nums2 = [2, 2]
intersection(nums1, nums2)
// [2]

nums1 = [4,9,5]
nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
intersection(nums1, nums2)
// [9, 4]

Constraints
- Length of the array <= 100000
- The values in the array will be in the range -1000000000 and 1000000000
- Expected time complexity: O(n+m) where n and m are the lengths of the array.
- Expected space complexity: O(max(n,m)).
